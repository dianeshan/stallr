## Overview

A web application to share toilet reviews. It can be an awful experience to have to go to a public restroom you havenâ€™t been to before, and see that it is very unsanitary. By having this web application, it is possible to plan out where to go when you need to go during your time out in public.

As a user of this application, you can create reviews for toilets you have been to and you can leave comments on other users reviews. You can sign up through google or you can sign up through the web application. You can change your bio and update your profile picture once you're logged in. Additionally you can add friends from the explore page and then they will show up in your profile! You can also edit and delete your posts. Get toileting!
